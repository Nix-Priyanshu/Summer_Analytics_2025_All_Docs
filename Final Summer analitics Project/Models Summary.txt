## Models Implemented

###  Model 1 – Baseline Linear

\[
P_{t+1} = P_t + \alpha \cdot \frac{\text{Occupancy}}{\text{Capacity}}
\]

- Simple model where price increases with how full a parking lot is
- `α` is a tunable constant (e.g., 2)
- Keeps prices between ₹5 and ₹20

### Model 2 – Demand-Based Dynamic Pricing

\[
\text{Demand} = a \cdot \frac{\text{Occupancy}}{\text{Capacity}} + b \cdot \text{QueueLength} - c \cdot \text{TrafficLevel} + d \cdot \text{SpecialDayFlag} + e \cdot \text{VehicleWeight}
\]

\[
P = \text{BasePrice} \cdot \left(1 + \lambda \cdot \sigma(\text{Demand}) \right)
\]

- Adds behavioral inputs: queue length, traffic, day type, vehicle
- Uses a sigmoid function to smooth wild swings in demand
- Clipped between ₹5 and ₹20

### Model 3 – Competitive Price Adjustment

- Tracks average price of all other lots at the same timestamp
- If **current lot price > others**, reduce it slightly (₹0.7)
- If **lower but not full**, increase it slightly
- Encourages better balance across lots and rerouting potential
