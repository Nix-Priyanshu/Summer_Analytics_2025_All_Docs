## üîÅ Architecture Flow

### End-to-End System Overview

1. **Dataset Ingestion**
   - The input CSV file contains parking lot updates over time
   - Includes features like occupancy, capacity, queue, traffic, timestamps, etc.

2. **Streaming Simulation**
   - Instead of processing the full dataset at once, the system reads **row-by-row**
   - This mimics real-time streaming behavior

3. **Pricing Models**
   - Each row is passed through a selected pricing model (`model1`, `model2`, or `model3`)
   - Model computes dynamic price based on current features

4. **Live Visualization**
   - The updated price is streamed into a **Bokeh live plot**
   - Shows real-time pricing curve with time step on x-axis and price on y-axis

5. **HTML Export**
   - Each plot is saved as an interactive `.html` file
   - Viewable offline or shareable via GitHub/Drive
