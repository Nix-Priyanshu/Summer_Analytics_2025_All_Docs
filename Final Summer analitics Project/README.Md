# Dynamic Real-Time Parking Pricing â€“ Capstone Project

This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing system for urban parking lots based on live data.  
It simulates streaming updates and adjusts prices dynamically using three progressively smarter models:

- **Model 1:** Linear pricing based on occupancy
- **Model 2:** Demand-based pricing (adds queue, traffic, day-type, vehicle weight)
- **Model 3:** Competitive pricing (adjusts against other lots)

Built in **Python** using **Bokeh** for live visualizations, this project reflects how real-world pricing can be optimized under demand and competition.
